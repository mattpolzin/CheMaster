CONTROLS:   i= refresh inventory (not really ever necessary)
            w= use water.
            r= use iron oxide (rust)
        space= more info on whatever is in front of you.
            m= mix substances (spereate elements with plus. if you want to decompose just 
                              name one element with no plus, and if it can decompose it will)





CAMDEN: IMAGES HAVE BEEN CHANGED, but i am not sure if any of the images that have been 
                                  changed will be part of your editor. I think i just made
                                  the explosion image smaller (64x64).
